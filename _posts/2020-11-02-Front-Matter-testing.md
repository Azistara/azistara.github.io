## What is an Aisha?
An Aisha is one of many different species that exist in Neopia. As a general rule Aishas are highly intelligent creatures that have a natural gift for magical things. Not all Aishas are native to Neopia though. There are some six-eared cousins to the Neopian Aishas (Alien Aishas) that love to meddle with new and exciting recipes, often with less than delicious results. 

### Aisha colours

As well as your basic four colours, Aishas come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes ranging from the super cute Baby Aisha to the swashbuckling Pirate Aisha! In order to own one of these more unusual Aishas you will need to find a magical paint brush or potion.

## Windows XP
Windows XP is an operating system produced byMicrosoft   as   part   of   the  Windows   NT   family   ofoperating   systems.   It   was   the   successor   to   bothWindows 2000 for professional users and Windows Mefor home users. It was released to manufacturing onAugust 24, 2001, and broadly released for retail sale onOctober 25, 2001.Development of Windows XP began in the late 1990s as"Neptune",   an   operating   system   (OS)   built   on   theWindows NT kernel which was intended specifically formainstream   consumer   use.   An   updated   version   ofWindows 2000 was also originally planned for thebusiness   market;   however,   in   January   2000,   bothprojects   were   scrapped   in   favor   of   a   single   OScodenamed "Whistler", which would serve as a singleOS platform for both consumer and business markets.As such, Windows XP was the first consumer edition ofWindows not to be based on MS-DOS.[5]Upon its release, Windows XP received critical acclaim,with critics noting increased performance and stability(especially in comparison to Windows Me), a moreintuitive user interface, improved hardware support,and expanded multimedia capabilities. However, someindustry reviewers were concerned by the new licensingmodel and product activation system.[6]Extended support for Windows XP ended on April 8,2014, after which the operating system ceased receivingfurther support or security updates (with exceptionalsecurity updates being made e.g. in 2019, to addresspotential ransomware threats, like BlueKeep) to mostusers. By August 2019, Microsoft (and others) hadended   support   for   games   on   Windows   XP.   As   ofAugust 2020, 0.8% of Windows PCs run WindowsXP,[7] and a 0.3% of all devices across all platforms runWindows XP. At least a few countries have double-digituse,   e.g.  Armenia,   where   it's   being   replaced   byWindows 10, with both operating systems having over40% use.[8]

### Development history of Windows XP

In the late 1990s, initial development of what would become Windows XP was focused on twoindividual products: "Odyssey", which was reportedly intended to succeed the future Windows 2000;and "Neptune", which was reportedly a consumer-oriented operating system using the Windows NTarchitecture, succeeding the MS-DOS-based Windows 98.[9]However, the projects proved to be too ambitious. In January 2000, shortly prior to the officialrelease of Windows 2000, technology writer Paul Thurrott reported that Microsoft had shelved both Neptune and Odyssey in favor of a new product codenamed "Whistler", after Whistler,   BritishColumbia, as many Microsoft employees skied at the Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort.[10] The goal ofWhistler was to unify both the consumer and business-oriented Windows lines under a single,Windows NT platform: Thurrott stated that Neptune had become "a black hole when all the featuresthat were cut from Windows Me were simply re-tagged as Neptune features. And since Neptune andOdyssey would be based on the same code-base anyway, it made sense to combine them into a singleproject".[11]At PDC on July 13, 2000, Microsoft announced that Whistler would be released during the secondhalf of 2001, and also unveiled the first preview build, 2250. The build notably introduced an earlyversion of Windows XP's visual styles system.[12]Microsoft released the first beta build of Whistler, build 2296, on October 31, 2000. Subsequentbuilds gradually introduced features that users of the release version of Windows XP would recognize,such as Internet Explorer 6.0, the Microsoft Product Activation system and the Bliss  desktopbackground.[13]Whistler was officially unveiled during a media event on February 5, 2001, under the name WindowsXP, where XP stands for "eXPerience".[14]In June 2001, Microsoft indicated that it was planning to, in conjunction with Intel and other PCmakers, spend at least 1 billion US dollars on marketing and promoting Windows XP.[15] The themeof the campaign, "Yes You Can", was designed to emphasize the platform's overall capabilities.Microsoft had originally planned to use the slogan "Prepare to Fly", but it was replaced because ofsensitivity issues in the wake of the September 11 attacks.[16]On August 24, 2001, Windows XP build 2600 was released to manufacturing (RTM). During aceremonial media event at Microsoft Redmond Campus, copies of the RTM build were given torepresentatives of several major PC manufacturers in briefcases, who then flew off on decoratedhelicopters. While PC manufacturers would be able to release devices running XP beginning onSeptember 24, 2001, XP was expected to reach general, retail availability on October 25, 2001. On thesame day, Microsoft also announced the final retail pricing of XP's two main editions, "Home" and"Professional".[17]
